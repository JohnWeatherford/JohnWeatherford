Knowledge Reflection

About me
Hi, I’m John Weatherford, an aspiring software developer with a passion for problem-solving, creativity, and hands-on learning. Throughout this course, I’ve built projects that strengthened my understanding of programming logic, web development, and real-world development workflows. I enjoy turning ideas into functional tools and continually improving my skills through practice and experimentation. My goal is to keep expanding my technical abilities and pursue a career in tech where I can build meaningful, user-focused solutions.

1. Project One – (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)

Description:
Was very baisc web site that had three pages. As well as a wireframe.

Features:
Clicky
no borken links

2. Project Two was a game

This game was to test you knowledge of coding langues with Hello world staments.

3. Project Three – (Git/GitHub Workflow)

Description:
A collaborative that applied version control principles to track changes and maintain a clean development history.

Features:

Organized commit structure

Branching and merging

Clear documentation

My Contribution:
I learned to break updates into smaller commits, resolve merge conflicts, and maintain a professional project repository.

Throughout this course, I gained a much deeper understanding of how software development works from start to finish. One of the biggest lessons I learned was how important it is to break problems down into smaller, manageable parts instead of trying to solve everything at once. I also became more comfortable using Git and GitHub, which helped me work more professionally and stay organized with my code.

The project that challenged me the most wasthis last project Echo ecause it forced me to think critically, debug carefully, and figure out why my code wasn’t behaving the way I expected. That experience improved my patience, my problem-solving approach, and my confidence in tackling harder tasks.
Going forward, I want to continue growing my skills in front-end frameworks, APIs, and more advanced technologies. This course helped me understand not just how to write code, but how to think like a developer—and that’s something I’ll carry with me into every future project.
